Ninja Blocks Arduino Source Code.
Developed by www.ninjablocks.com based on Arduino and other Open Source libraries.

Version 0.37: 30th July 2012 by JP Liew
	- fixed RCSwitch to add leading zeros when sending JSON data in binary
	- fixed GREEN LED blink on GREEN when receiving 433 data
	
Version 0.36: 5th July 2012 by JP Liew
	- fixed Relay digitalWrite() not in OUTPUT mode
	- added Device ID 1003, DATA="VNO" for cape to report software version
	- disabled responding to DID 1001 with the new all in one TX & RX board
	- changed 433 transmit from 5 times to 8 times	

Version 0.35: 2nd July 2012 by JP Liew
	- added handling for Relay Breakout board. 2nd July 2012
	- added reading ID for Relay Breakout board. 2nd July 2012

Version 0.34.1: 22th June 2012 by JP Liew
	- added blinkLED() for push button triggered.  22nd June 2012
	
Version 0.34: 15th June 2012 by JP Liew
	- added doOnBoardRGB() to report status of RGB Led.  15th June 2012
	- added doJSONResponse() to ack server messages. 15th June 2012
	- added doJSONError(int) to report error. 15th June 2012

Version 0.33: 
	- added sound sensor support and blink RED LED if sound level exceeds 0. 1st June 2012
	- fixed 433Mhz Tx & Rx interfering. 1st June 2012
	- fixed readSerialString() stucked in while loop. 1st June 2012
	- changed blinkGreenLED() to blinkLED() so that any LED could be blinked. 1st June 2012

Version 0.32: 31st May 2012 by JP Liew
	- changed TMP102 to read in 30 sec interval, reading too quickly will cause chip to heat up, thus giving slightly higher temperature reading. 30th May 2012
	- added code to prevent multiple creation of ISR in enableReceive() for RCSwitch library. 31st May 2012
	- added 433Mhz Rx module code. 31st May 2012
	- added blinkGreenLED() when valid 433Mhz code received. 31st May 2012

Version 0.31: 29th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- changed JSON protocol, shorten to G,V,D,DA
	- fixed RGB ID bug, should be 1000
	- added UNKNOWN sensor to return ADC value
	- added 433Mhz Tx module code
	- changed DHT22 humidity & temp to return float value
	
Version 0.2: 25th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- restructured JSON protocol to encapsulate devices with GUID, VID, DID and DATA
