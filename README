Ninja Blocks Arduino Source Code.
Developed by www.ninjablocks.com based on Arduino and other Open Source libraries.

Version 0.33: 
	- added sound sensor support and blink RED LED if sound level exceeds 0. 1st June 2012
	- fix 433Mhz Tx & Rx interfering. 1st June 2012
	- fixed readSerialString() stucked in while loop. 1st June 2012
	- changed blinkGreenLED() to blinkLED() so that any LED could be blinked. 1st June 2012

Version 0.32: 31st May 2012 by JP Liew
	- changed TMP102 to read in 30 sec interval, reading too quickly will cause chip to heat up, thus giving slightly higher temperature reading. 30th May 2012
	- prevent multiple creation of ISR in enableReceive() for RCSwitch library. 31st May 2012
	- added 433Mhz Rx module code. 31st May 2012
	- added blinkGreenLED() when valid 433Mhz code received.	31st May 2012

Version 0.31: 29th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- JSON protocol shorten to G,V,D,DA
	- fix RGB ID bug, should be 1000
	- added UNKNOWN sensor to return ADC value
	- added 433Mhz Tx module code
	- changed DHT22 humidity & temp to return float value
	
Version 0.2: 25th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- restructure JSON protocol to encapsulate devices with GUID, VID, DID and DATA
